        <p>June 22nd recognizes a batter dipped and deep fried bite of deliciousness that runs rings around other appetizers.  It’s <a href="https://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-onion-rings-day-june-22/">National Onion Rings Day!</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>Also found in Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and some parts of Asia, onion rings exact origin are unknown.</p>

            <p>A recipe called “Fried Onions with Parmesan Cheese” is included in John Mollard’s 1802 cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Easy and Refined.  Within the recipe, it suggests cutting onions into 1/2 inch rings, dipping them into a batter made of flour, cream, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese then deep frying them in boiling lard. It recommends serving them with a sauce made of melted butter and mustard.</p>

            <p>Some believe that a recipe for French Fried Onions (not claiming to be the originator of the recipe) appeared in the Middletown, NY Daily Times on January 13, 1910.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The Pig Stand restaurant chain, founded in Oak Cliff, Texas in the early 1920s is one of the claimants to the onion rings invention.</p>
